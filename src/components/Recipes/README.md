## 📚 Assignment Adaptation

This version of the Odin Recipes App is an advanced take on the original assignment from The Odin Project, which was focused on HTML skills. This project extends the concept by incorporating React, TypeScript, and Material Ui to create a more interactive and sophisticated application. The assignment's key elements, such as creating a basic recipe website with multiple pages and links, are elevated through the use of modern web development tools and practices, showcasing the evolution from simple HTML to a fully functional React application.
