		<p>
			This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
			made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A
			more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta
			but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese
			and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy
			green salad and crusty garlic bread.

			<li>Ingredients</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat
					(½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
				</li>
				<li>
					Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the
					ground meat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can
					of crushed tomatoes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
					parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from
					the tomatoes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned
					with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
				</li>
				<li>
					Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe
					calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
					variety to save time.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and
					Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
				</li>
				<li>
					Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they
					act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer
					together).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Steps</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until
					browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking
					until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products,
					half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt,
					oregano, and sugar.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted
					water until they're al dente.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese,
					eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper
					in a bowl.
				</li>
				<li>
					Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the
					recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella)
					until the lasagna is assembled.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated
					oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue
					baking until the top is golden brown.
				</li>
			</ol>
